## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Code needs to go within chunks 
```{r}

print("LearningRMarkdown")

````


```{r}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Load libraries 
```{r message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```
## Part 1 

Load data 

```{r}
getwd()
```

```{r}
plant_growth_rate <- read.csv("Data/plant.growth.rate.csv")
head(plant_growth_rate)
```


Create scatter plot 

```{r}
ggplot(plant_growth_rate, aes(x = soil.moisture.content, y = plant.growth.rate)) + 
  geom_point(size = 2, alpha = 0.8, colour = "cornflowerblue") +
  theme_bw() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, colour = "deeppink3", fill = "pink")
```
